  <h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="https://people.rit.edu/ac7717/csci716/index.html">Privacy Preserving Planar Point Location:</a></h4>
  <p style="margin-top:0">This webpage contains the details of my final project for the Computational Geometry Course (CSCI 716). For this project, I explored the possibility of conducting Planar Point location through Trapezoidal Maps given that the coordinates
	of the point are encrypted and that the trapezoidal map is provided and public.</p>

  <h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="https://people.rit.edu/ac7717/xcipher.pdf"> X-Cipher - Achieving Data Resiliency in Homomorphic Ciphertexts:</a></h4>:
	<p style="margin-top:0">X-Cipher is a project I worked on while studying under Dr. Peizhao Hu. Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows for computations on encrypted data without decryption. HE is commonly applied to outsource computation on private data. Due to the additional risks caused by data outsourcing, the ability to recover from losses is essential. However, doing so on data encrypted under an HE scheme introduces additional challenges for recovery and usability. X-Cipher aims to make HE data resilient by ensuring it is private and fault-tolerant simultaneously at all stages during data outsourcing. X-Cipher allows for data recovery without decryption and maintains its ability to recover and keep data private when a cluster server has been compromised. X-Cipher allows for reduced ciphertext storage overhead by introducing novel encoding and leveraging previously introduced ciphertext packing. X-Cipherâ€™s capabilities were evaluated on a synthetic dataset, and compared to prior work to demonstrate that X-Cipher enables additional security capabilities while enabling privacy-preserving outsourced computations.</p> -->

 <h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="https://sites.google.com/udel.edu/rocksat-c-2019/">RockSat-C 2018-2019:</a></h4>
 <p style="margin-top:0">While at the University of Delaware, I participated in RockSat-C: a program run by Colorado Space Grant that launches college student projects in a suborbital rocket at Wallops Space Facility. The Delaware Space Consortium sponsored my team's participation in this program. Our main project involved collecting data to form current-voltage (I-V) curves of a prototype SiC HEMT transistor designed by UDEL's Dr. Zeng and her team. Our system performed multiple voltage sweeps during the rocket's flight to analyze changes in the transistor's characteristics. We equipped our system with a Geiger counter to estimate changes in radiation levels along the flight path. An accelerometer and GPS receiver collected 3-axis positioning data and location coordinates. These projects provided supplemental information to the I-V data that was collected. Two 12V li-po batteries powered the entire experiment, and they were mounted to a custom 3-D printed internal structure inside the capsule. Our power regulator circuit converted the 12V source to various voltage supply sources for each component in the system.</p>
